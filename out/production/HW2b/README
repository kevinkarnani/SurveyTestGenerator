This is HW2b written by Kevin Karnani, due on May 10, 2021.
Important Notes:
    - The ConsoleMenu.java class is HEAVILY dependent on the InputOutput package.
    - The InputOutput package, written by Sean Grimes, was taken from the Student repo.
    - The InputOutput package is a combination of FileUtils, SerializationHelper, and the AbstractInputOutput package.
    - Sean Grimes gave me his explicit permission to use all the files and functions present in InputOutput.
    - I have written a test survey. I have stored the survey and sample responses in src/serialized/*.
    - The requirements pdf was ambiguous as to how to store/display responses. Therefore, I did not implement a way to
      display responses, and I directly serialize the survey with the filled responses array. Not sure why there was no
      display requirement.
    - No errors as far as I have tested. The code is messier than I was hoping it to be... but such is life.
